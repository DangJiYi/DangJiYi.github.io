<p>For several years, Americans have enjoyed teleshopping-watching TV and buying things by phone. Now teleshopping is starting in Europe. In a number of European countries, people can turn on their TVs and shop for clothes, jewelry, food, toys and many other things.</br><br>
Teleshopping is becoming popular in Sweden, for example. The biggest Swedish<br>
company sells different kinds of things on TV in 15 European countries, and in one year it made $100 million In France there are two teleshopping channels, and the French spend about $20 million a year to buy things through those channels.</br><br>
In Germany, until last year teleshopping was only possible on one channel for 1 hour every day. Then the government allowed more teleshopping. Other channels can open for tele-business, including the largest American teleshopping company and a 24-hour teleshopping company. German businesses are hoping this new teleshopping will help them sell more things.</br><br>
Some people like teleshopping because it allows them to do their shopping without leaving their homes . With all the problems of traffic in the cities, this is an important reason But at the same time, other Europeans do not like this new way of shopping. They can do teleshopping “junk on the air”. Many Europeans usually worry about the quality of the things for sale on TV. Good quality is important to them and they believe they cannot be sure about the quality of the things on TV.</br><br>
The need for high quality means that European teleshopping companies will have to be different from the American companies. They will have to be more careful about the quality of the things they sell. They will also have to work harder to sell things that the buyers cannot touch or see in person.</br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone needs friends. We all like to feel close to someone. It is nice to have a friend to talk laugh and do things with. Surely there are times when we need to be alone. We don' t always want people around. But we would feel very lonely if we never had a friend.</br><br>
No two people are just the same. Sometimes friends don' t get alone. That doesn't mean that they no longer like each other. Most of the time they will make up and go on being friends.</br><br>
Sometimes friends move away. Then we feel very sad. We miss them very much. But we can call them and write to them It could be that we will even see them again And we can make new friends. It is surprising to find out how much we like new people when we get to know them.</br><br>
Families sometimes name their children after a close friend. Many places are named after men and women who have been friendly to people in a town. Some parks are named this way SO are some schools. We think of these people when we go to these places.</br><br>
There' s more good news for people who have friends. They live longer than people who don' t. Why? It could be that they are happier Being happy helps you stay well. Or it could be just knowing that someone cares.</br><br>
If someone cares about you, you take better care of yourself</br></p>
